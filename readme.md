# SwiftUI test app
### This is a landmarks app created to show benefits of SwiftUI framework

SwiftUI offers several advantages that make it a powerful choice for building user interfaces:

1. **Declarative Syntax:** SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax that allows you to describe your UI's structure and behaviour. This makes your code more intuitive and easier to understand.

2. **Automatic Updates:** SwiftUI automatically updates your user interface whenever your data changes. This helps in creating a reactive UI where changes are reflected instantly.

3. **Cross-Platform:** You can build apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS using the same SwiftUI codebase, reducing development time and effort.

4. **Preview in Real Time:** SwiftUI provides a live preview feature that lets you see the changes you make in your code in real time, making UI development more interactive.

5. **Animation Integration:** SwiftUI seamlessly integrates animations into your UI components, allowing you to create smooth and interactive user experiences.

6. **Interactive Prototyping:** With its simple syntax, SwiftUI is excellent for quickly prototyping and experimenting with UI designs.
